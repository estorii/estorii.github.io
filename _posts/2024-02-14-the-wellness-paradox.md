&emsp; I thought I was healthy until  realities of maintaining that health began to unfold in a routine that felt more like a choice than enjoyment.  Each morning, I'm greeted by supplements and things so called heathy food, each marking a battle between what is and what could be. <!--more-->

&emsp; The ginkgo pill, my first act of the day, is a nod to the memories slipping through the years, following this, the hormone-balancer, then comes Vitamin D3, a stand-in for the sun on days it hides behind the clouds, paired with ION and vitamin C—a duo believed to carry sustained energy. Yet, it's the morning's dose of apple cider vinegar that truly tests my will. Its acrid taste is a daily confrontation, a reminder of the lengths we go to in the name of health. The cold, refreshing water I once enjoyed is now replaced by lukewarm sips, a concession to the promise of well-being.

&emsp; Coffee, once a source of simple pleasure, has been stripped down to a bare, unsweetened cappuccino. My once-cherished caramel macchiato has been reluctantly set aside in favor of sleep's gentle embrace. Thus, I've pared down my indulgence to a single cup of coffee in the morning, later seeking refuge in the calm that matcha promises.

&emsp; Come evening, it’s time for more ginkgo and hormone balancing, followed by a cup of dried jujubes and ginger tea to support my sleep and well-being. And there's Glutathione before bed, an essential piece of my health puzzle. Sugar, once a staple of sweetness in my life, is now just a memory. Even tracking my sleep, which I used to think cumbersome, has become a crucial nightly habit. And I've added a few minutes of exercise each morning. 

&emsp; Again, I thought I was healthy until the changes I made to maintain my health made me reconsider. Are we really as healthy as we believe? Was my previous lifestyle truly unhealthy, or merely uninformed by the stringent standards I now uphold?

&emsp; This introspection brings me to a crossroads that questioning the very nature of health and happiness. In my pursuit of well-being, I find myself navigating a delicate balance between sacrifice and satisfaction, wondering whether life's true essence is not in strict routines but in the small, happy moments we give ourselves permission to enjoy.
