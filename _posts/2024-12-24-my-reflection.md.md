&emsp; Today is a beautiful day—not just because it's December 24th, 2024, but because it's Christmas, the most wonderful time of the year.
It’s been a while since I’ve written anything outside of class essays, so I decided to take a moment to reflect on this year—or at least the parts my mind holds vividly. <!--more-->

&emsp;**Gratitude** <br>
&emsp;This year, I faced one of my biggest fears: I signed up for Literature & Performance - basically, it’s an English writing class. A class I had always been intimidated by turned out to be one of the most wonderful experiences I’ve ever had. To my surprise, I ended up with the highest score this semester.

It wasn’t just a class—it was an adventure. We studied classic plays, from its earliest beginnings to the 2000s. It was a “phone-free” class. Initially, I thought it would be hard, but our professor’s passion for his field was contagious. One of my favorite discoveries was the original version of Romeo & Juliet (there’s no window scene at all, and we’re forbidden to see Equus). Before this class, I never understood why people chose to study English Literature, but my professor, and even my TAs, had a vibe—a “theatre” or “art” vibe, as I like to call it—and they were so knowledgeable.

For our final, our professor stood at the door, suit and all, welcoming us into the exam room. And for the first time, I received a thank-you email from a TA when semester ended. These small gestures meant so much to me. Now, I find myself looking for plays to see and dreaming of going to Broadway someday.

&emsp;**Health and Dreams** ,<br>
&emsp;This year, I also turned my focus to my health. I started going to the gym and doing pilates regularly.

&emsp;And then there’s my dream—my so-called “American dream.” I won’t go into too much detail here, but for the first time in my life, I have something I’m willing to fight for. I sat down, planned my future, sought out opportunities, and committed myself to pursuing my goal. Of course, it hasn’t been easy. There were moments of exhaustion, times when I felt like giving up. But thinking about my aspiration gives me the strength to keep going.

&emsp;**Dilemmas and Fears** <br>
&emsp;This year wasn’t without its struggles. I found myself revisiting the past, dwelling on mistakes I made years ago. I’m scared of repeating them, of falling into the same traps for (I hope) not the same kind of person.

&emsp;This place is beautiful. Too beautiful. It wraps me in its calm, a kind of stillness where no one seems to dream big or chase ambitions. And somehow, that beauty pulls at me, whispering that it’s okay to settle down. To stop running. To stay. And to be honest, I hate that whisper. I hate it more than anything about living here. I’m scared that one day I’ll lose the fire inside me—the dreams I’ve built my life around—and let myself sink into a life of comfort: 9-to-5 job, marriage, kids,... That’s not me. That’s not the reason why I‘m here from the get-go.

Yet the fear won’t let go. It lingers—haunting, a quiet tug at my heart that, at certain moments, makes me pause and chase answers I can’t quite name.

**Home** <br>
As always, at this time of year, I miss Saigon. Its heartbeat echoes in my memories, a reminder of where I’ve been - home.
