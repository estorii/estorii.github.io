# About Me – Esther Nguyen for VP Equity & Sustainability 

&emsp; Hi SFU! I’m **Esther Nguyen (they/them)**, and I’m running to be your **VP Equity & Sustainability** at SFSS.  

&emsp; SFU is a place of **diverse experiences**—students juggling **long commutes, working part-time jobs, navigating financial stress, and advocating for equity and climate justice**. I have seen firsthand the **power of student-led change**, and I believe SFU needs leadership that **listens, learns, and takes action**.  

<!--more-->  

## **📌 My Experience:**  

- **Student Ambassador at the Global Student Centre (GSC)** – Creating **inclusive spaces** where students from all backgrounds feel welcomed and heard.  
- **Volunteer at SFU’s Sexual Violence Support & Prevention Office (SVSPO)** – Advocating for **safer, more supportive communities** through education and dialogue.  
- **Hospital Volunteer at Surrey Memorial Hospital** – Engaging with **community health issues** and understanding **systemic barriers to care**.  

&emsp; Through my work, I have engaged with students across campus and seen how **deeply equity, sustainability, and student well-being are connected**. As **VP Equity and Sustainability**, I will ensure that these connections are **not just recognized—but acted upon**.  

## **📢 Why Am I Running?**  

We are **students**, but we are also **workers, caregivers, activists, and change-makers**. I want to ensure **SFSS stands with students** and fights for our collective well-being.  

### **✅ My Priorities:**  

- **🌱 Climate & Environmental Justice** – Advocating for SFU to **divest from harmful industries, improve green spaces, and commit to tangible climate action**.  
- **💙 Accessible & Affordable Student Supports** – Pushing for **expanded mental health resources, financial aid, and accessibility services**.  
- **📢 Equity Beyond Buzzwords** – Ensuring that SFSS’s commitment to **anti-oppression and social justice** translates into **real policy change**, not just statements.  
- **🤝 Stronger Student Representation** – Making sure that **marginalized voices are at the table**, not just an afterthought in decision-making.  

## **📬 SFU is Changing—Let’s Make Sure It Changes for the Better!**  

We **deserve an SFU** where students are not just **surviving—but thriving**. Let’s build a future that is **sustainable, just, and student-powered**.
