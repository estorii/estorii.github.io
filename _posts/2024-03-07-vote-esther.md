# Vote Esther for VP Equity & Sustainability 

&emsp; Hi SFU! I’m **Esther Nguyen (they/them)**, and I’m running to be your **VP Equity & Sustainability** at SFSS.  

&emsp; SFU is a place of **diverse experiences**—students juggling **long commutes, working part-time jobs, navigating financial stress, and advocating for equity and climate justice**. I have seen firsthand the **power of student-led change**, and I believe SFU needs leadership that **listens, learns, and takes action**.

## **📌 My Experience:**  

- **✅ Student Ambassador at the Global Student Centre (GSC)** – Creating **inclusive spaces** where students from all backgrounds feel welcomed and heard.

- **✅ Hospital Volunteer at Surrey Memorial Hospital** – Engaging with **community health issues** and understanding **systemic barriers to care**.  

&emsp; Through my work, I have engaged with students across campus and seen how **deeply equity, sustainability, and student well-being are connected**. As **VP Equity and Sustainability**, I will ensure that these connections are **not just recognized—but acted upon**.

- **🌱 Equity Beyond Buzzwords** – Turning social justice commitments into real action.  

## **📬 SFU is Changing—Let’s Make Sure It Changes for the Better!**  

We **deserve an SFU** where students are not just **surviving—but thriving**. Let’s build a future that is **sustainable, just, and student-powered**.
