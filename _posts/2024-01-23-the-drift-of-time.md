&emsp; In the book of life, each of us writes a unique pattern of friendship, some vibrant and numerous, others more muted and selective. But as the wheel of time turns, I can’t help but ponder does the relentless drift of time has left some companionships as mere Instagram follow buttons? <!--more--> The friends we used to see every day now live in different cities, or even different countries. Work, family, and personal commitments fill up our days, leaving little room for friendships, which once were a given, now turning into a luxury item.  We often find ourselves merely observing each other's lives through social media updates, rarely finding the time or words to reply or reach out, as if our once fun conversations have faded into silent scrolling. <br>


&emsp; I feel a sense of loss. <br>
&emsp; He inspired me a lot in my studies. We used to walk around the city center in the evenings, nursing milk teas and street food until midnight. I'll never forget the time he filmed my favourite rapper's concert for me, or how readily he offered to help with my homework. We shared thousands of memories. The connection that once seemed unbreakable now feels distant. In the busy ebb and flow of life, our paths have diverged, leaving behind a silence that echoes with the remnants of a companionship that once meant a lot to me.

&emsp; In that line of though, I realized: it's not time or the march of life to blame, nor anyone else. If there's any responsibility to be acknowledged, it lies with me, and I embrace this realization not with regret, but as a reflection of my own choices and growth. I understand now that our paths may not always align as we once did, yet the memories, the lessons learned, and the moments of unspoken understanding will forever resonate within me.

&emsp; This journey of reflection has taught me to cherish the friendships of my past, embrace the connections of my present, and remain open to the relationships that the future holds. For each person who crosses our path leaves a unique imprint, and for my dear friend who inspired and stood by me through so much, my gratitude is boundless. Our companionship might have shifted in its dynamics, but it will always be the best-cherished chapter in the story of my life. <br>
&emsp; You are, and always will be, an integral part of my story.
