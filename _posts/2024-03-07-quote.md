&emsp; On the first day of Spring class, a quote on the last slide of my instructor's presentation, casting a long shadow over my journey ahead: “What seems impossible today will one day become your warm-up.” Little did I know, these words would etch themselves into the narrative of my struggles and triumphs. At first, understanding lectures and labs was tough, with scores far below my expectations, the thought of withdrawing loomed over me. But the cost as an international student made quitting a hard choice. <!--more-->

&emsp; In my quest for improvement, I used Anki—a flashcard app that changed how I studied  through active recall and spaced repetition. At first, I hesitated to switch to Anki, however, it’s a game-changer. It took effort to set up, but it paid off. And so I leaped. It enabled me to significantly improve my grades in both the lab and lecture exams, transforming despair into hope and reaffirming my belief in the power of resilience and adaptability.

&emsp; This journey taught me an invaluable lesson: the essence of overcoming challenges lies not in the avoidance of failure but in the relentless pursuit of success through persistence and being open to change. The once daunting quote had now become a testament to my growth, a reminder that what once seemed impossible had indeed become my warm-up.
